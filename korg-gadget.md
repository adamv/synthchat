# Korg Gadget

Korg Gadget is an audio workstation originally for iOS, now for Mac/PC and Nintendo Switch as well.
This document will focus on the iOS version.

Gadget's instruments are called "gadgets", and include synthesizers, samplers and drum machines.
Some gadgets come with the base purchase, some are IAP, some can be added by buying Korg Module
and its IAPs, and some can be added by buying standalone Korg apps.

Many gadgets are tributes to other famous synthesizers, which aren't mentioned by name due to
copyright reasons.

Gadget is geared toward making various styles of electronic music, and the available sounds
reflect that.
