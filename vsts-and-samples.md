## Korg Collection ($250)

The [Korg Collection](https://www.korg.com/us/products/software/korg_collection/index.php)
(previously "Korg Legacy Collection") are the  official VSTs of various Korg synthesizers. The UI on the
ARP Odyssey is new; the others are pretty old and behind their iPad ports. All the sounds you are
looking for are there though.

The lineup includes:

* ARP Odyssey
* Korg MS-20
* Korg Polysix
* Korg Mono/Poly
* Korg M1
* Korg Wavestation

A separate effects unit is included in the bundle as well.

## Arturia V Collection 6 ($500)

[Arturia V](https://www.arturia.com/products/analog-classics/v-collection/overview) includes
high-quality emulations of 21 digital, analog and electromechanical instruments as well as
many models of piano.

## Samples from Mars ($99)

[Samples from Mars](https://samplesfrommars.com/) sells libraries of high quality samples of
most of the usual classic drum machines. Their "everything" pack goes for $99, but has been
seen on sale for even less. Costs money, but is possibly the easiest way to get these samples
as well as pre-built libraries for Ableton and other DAWs.

Note: the Linn samples seem to have been removed from their catalog?
